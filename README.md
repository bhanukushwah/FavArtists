# FavArtists
This app at its core is simple. It will be an archive of vinyl records for sale and categorized by artist. We won't be implementing a ton of foreign logic but rather just getting the foundations of an API-based application in order. We'll touch on authentication (not using Devise ðŸ˜‰) and basic CRUD.

There will be two apps.

A Ruby on Rails backend - This will handle our data, sessions, and authentication.
A Vue.js frontend - This will be the view layer but also the one responsible for sending and receiving data to our rails-based backend. The front-end will run on a different instance using the Vue-CLI to help us set up an app.
